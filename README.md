Virtual Physics Simulation Lab
A comprehensive Python-based interactive simulation platform for 10 fundamental engineering physics experiments with real-time visualizations and data analysis.
🔬 Overview
This virtual lab allows students and educators to perform classic physics experiments through interactive simulations. Users can either input their own experimental data or run automated simulations with randomly generated values that follow theoretical models.
✨ Features

Interactive Data Entry: Input your own measurements for personalized experiments
Automated Simulations: Run all experiments sequentially with realistic random data
Visual Analysis: Each experiment generates professional matplotlib visualizations
Theoretical Comparison: Experimental data is plotted against theoretical predictions
Educational Content: Each experiment includes theoretical background and formulas

🧪 Available Experiments

Simple Pendulum - Period vs Length relationship
Ohm's Law - Current vs Voltage characteristics
Projectile Motion - Trajectory visualization
Newton's Law of Cooling - Temperature decay over time
